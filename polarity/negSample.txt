I have been talking to 5 agents so far, still no end to my pain... phone can't be dead for 10 days!!! 
Been a loyal customer for 3 years enjoying the service, the last three months has been horrible 
I took the day off yesterday for the installation, whole family was around and the technician did not show up. How do I cancel the service now?
